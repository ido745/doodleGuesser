# 🧠 QuickDraw CNN Classifier

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to recognize doodles from the [Quick, Draw!](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data) dataset. The project includes training code, model export, and an interactive drawing app to test the model locally.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- `keys.py` – Contains the list of categories to include in the model.
- `loadData.py` – Downloads and prepares data from the web.
- `modelTraining.py` – Trains the CNN and saves the model as `QuickDraw_CNN_35_classes.h5`.
- `QuickDraw_CNN_35_classes.h5` – The trained CNN model (output file).
- `doodle_app.py` – A simple Pygame-based app to draw and classify doodles using the trained model. This file must be in the same directory as the saved model.

## 🚀 How to Train the Model Yourself

1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Upload the following files:  
   - `keys.py`  
   - `loadData.py`  
   - `modelTraining.py`  
   (Drag and drop the files into the left-side file panel.)
3. Run the training script using:
   ```python
   !python modelTraining.py
   ```
4. Download the output file: `QuickDraw_CNN_35_classes.h5`.
5. Place `QuickDraw_CNN_35_classes.h5` in the same folder as `doodle_app.py`.

## 🎮 Running the App Locally

Requirements:
- Python 3.11.0 or lower (due to TensorFlow compatibility)
- Install the following libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install pygame
  pip install tensorflow
  pip install numpy
  pip install Pillow
  ```

Then run:
```bash
python doodle_app.py
```

Use the canvas to draw a doodle — the model will predict what you drew!

## ⚙️ Tips for Customization

Feel free to experiment with:
- Number of categories (`keys.py`)
- Model architecture and hyperparameters (`modelTraining.py`)
- Training duration and dataset size

## 📊 Current Model Performance

- **Test Accuracy**: `92.56%`  
  _(Using 35 categories from the QuickDraw dataset)_

## 📝 Notes

- The model uses a simple CNN architecture suitable for quick training and good performance on 28x28 grayscale images.
- Data is fetched from the official QuickDraw dataset hosted on Google's servers.
